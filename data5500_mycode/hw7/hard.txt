Hard: (Essay, 7 points)

3. Explain the process of deleting a node from a binary search tree in Python. 
Discuss how you would handle different cases, such as deleting a node with one, 
or two children. Additionally, explain any potential challenges or edge cases that 
may arise during the deletion process and how you would address them. 


There are 3 potiental cases when deleting a node:

1. It's a leaf node with no children so you simply delete the node.

2. The node has one child, so the child takes the spot of the parent. 

3. If the node has two children you either take the smallest value on the right side
    and replace the deleted node or use the largest value from the left side to 
    replace it.

When deleting a node with one child, python should automatically move up the child, 
keeping it from becoming an orphan, but if it doesn't you'll have to move up the child
manually. 

When deleting duplicate values delete the second duplicate value so it's children can 
simply move up. 




ChatGPT prompts: 
here's a screenshot of a binary tree. From what i understand, 
to delete a node on the right you take the smallest node in the right subtree 
and replace it. So if you deleted 5 you would replace it with 6 but then 7 
would become an orphan. am i understanding how to delete nodes correctly?
